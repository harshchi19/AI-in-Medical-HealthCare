The gap between the need for treatment and its provision is wide all over the world; and is often poor in quality when delivered.

In 2019, 1 in every 8 people, or 970 million people around the world were living with a mental disorder, with anxiety and depressive disorders the most common (1). In 2020, the number of people living with anxiety and depressive disorders rose significantly because of the COVID-19 pandemic.  Initial estimates show a 26% and 28% increase respectively for anxiety and major depressive disorders in just one year (2). While effective prevention and treatment options exist, most people with mental disorders do not have access to effective care. Many people also experience stigma, discrimination and violations of human rights.

In an era where mental health disorders continue to affect individuals worldwide irrespective of age, ethnicity, or geographic location, the gap between diagnosis and effective treatment remains a significant challenge. Addressing this gap is crucial, as societal stigmas and inadequate healthcare facilities often hinder timely intervention and support. Our research endeavors to bridge this divide through the development of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models capable of diagnosing mental health disorders based on diverse sets of symptoms reported by patients.
According to the World Health Organization (WHO), mental health disorders affect one in four people globally at some point in their lives, with depression alone affecting over 264 million individuals worldwide. Despite the pervasive nature of these disorders, a substantial number of cases go undiagnosed or undertreated due to barriers ranging from cultural norms to limited access to mental health services (WHO, 2020). The National Institutes of Health (NIH) underscores the importance of innovative approaches in mental health diagnosis, emphasizing the need for accurate and accessible tools that can enhance early detection and intervention (NIH, 2021).
Our primary objective is to leverage advancements in artificial intelligence to create robust diagnostic tools that can effectively identify mental health conditions early on, thereby facilitating timely treatment and improving outcomes for individuals globally. By focusing on the intersection of technology and mental health, we aim to contribute to the broader effort of reducing the burden of mental disorders and promoting well-being across diverse populations.
This paper explores the development and validation of our ML and DL models, highlighting their potential to revolutionize mental health care by providing scalable, accurate, and culturally sensitive diagnostic solutions. Through empirical evidence and critical analysis, we aim to underscore the transformative impact of integrating technology into mental health care practices, ultimately striving for a future where mental health services are equitable and accessible to all.
